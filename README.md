"# AUTOSEARCHX" 

The project functions as a basic search engine for car brands, catering to users who may not be knowledgeable about specific car details such as mileage. It allows users to input a car make, and based on this input, it retrieves and displays available brands for that make from a provided dataset. This simplicity caters to users who prioritize brand preference over technical details like mileage, making it convenient for those who seek to select a car primarily based on brand recognition or preference.
